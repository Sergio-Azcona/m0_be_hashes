# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
i could not get the last Q in the second hashes within the given time (15 minutes) to work. also, the Array + Hashes combo i will need to practice
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
it has gone pretty well. i like digital notes as it is easier to search ( cmd + F) ... that being said, it is easier for info to get lost when it is electronically

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
i try to solve it on my own. i do google but have found that there are a ton of ways thrown at you...and i do not know which are trustworthy yet
